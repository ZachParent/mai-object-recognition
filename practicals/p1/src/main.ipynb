    "\n",
    "The goal is to practice advanced deep learning architectures for multi-label classification in [Pascal VOC dataset](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/index.html). We specifically check ResNet50, Inception and MobileNet. We will see 1) how pretrained ResNet50 on imagenet performs on multi-label images, 2) how to modify classification head and 3) implementation of F1 metric.\n",

    "### NOTES\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hyperparameters are modifiable,\n",
    "- The dataset is PASCAL VOC 2012,\n",
    "- The code uses the KERAS library,\n",
    "- The code can run in google colab.\n",
    "- How to finetune on a pretrained model not included (i.e. freeze the pretrained network and train the head, then finetune everything),\n",
    "- No validation set has been defined. The test and validation sets are the same."
