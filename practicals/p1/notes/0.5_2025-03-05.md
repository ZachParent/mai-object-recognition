# updates
## **repo updates**
- data dir
- black formatter
## **code structure**
- main.ipynb
	- should basically never change now, except to make it run a new experiment in a new cell
- train_and_test.py
- config.py
- experiment_config.py
- load_data.py
- augmentation.py
- metrics.py
- visualization.py
## **running on colab**
- slooooow but working
# remaining issues
# next steps
1. review/refine research questions
2. perform 1 full training and testing?
3. determine and implement performance metrics
4. configure experiments and update code to support this
	1. default experiment
	2. hyperparams experiment
	3. data augmentation and imbalanced handling experiment
# research questions
- Training
    - Pretrained weights with warmup
    - Pretrained weights without warmup
    - Pretrained from scratch
- Hyperparams
    - Batch size [16, 32, 64, (128)]
    - Learning rate
    - Optimizer
    - â€¦
- Which performance measure?
    - We are looking for whatever the fuck multilabel
