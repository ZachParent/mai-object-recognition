## Notes

### Getting Metrics from YOLO

- Avoid retrieving the full history; focus only on the final Dice score.

### Pixel Resolution Experiment

- **Time constraint:** Run **Deeplab** (best model) with the best hyperparameters.

## Todos

### Pedro - Run best model w/ high resolution

### Pedro - Run balancing

### Bruno - Balancing

- [ ] Identify **poorly performing classes**.
- [ ] **Wait to perform cutoff** until further analysis.

### Report Sections

- [ ] **Bruno** writes **Section 3.1**.
- [ ] **Marti** writes **Section 3.2**.
- [ ] **Zachary** - Results analysis.
- [ ] **Bruno** - Results for balancing.
- [ ] **Sheena** - Introduction.
- [ ] **Zach** - Creates an overarching plot.
- [ ] **Zach** - Adds a table comparing **accuracy** and **Dice score**.

### Code & Review

- [ ] **Sheena** - Merge `dataset.py` cleanup.
- [ ] **Bruno** - Review confusion matrices.

### Additional Considerations

- [ ] **Show curve for the last training?**
  - To demonstrate we could have trained longer to improve further, but time was limited.

## Milestones

- [ ] **Pedro** gets weights → Runs Bruno’s balancing.
  - **Dependency:** Data availability, not development.
- [ ] **Decide the best model** → Prioritize **high resolution vs. more epochs**.
- [ ] **Marti** depends on best model results to compare with YOLO.
- [ ] **Compile final results**.
